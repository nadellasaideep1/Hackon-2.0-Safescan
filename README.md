This is Safescan and Safescan's admin portal. So the idea of my app is that every shop is provided with a qr code and shop id.So when anyone need to enter the shop they need to scan the qr code using the app or type the shop id.Hence when the qr code is scanned the time of entry,email,shop name and shop id are saved to our database.So if there is a positive case recorded in a soecific area all the people can be sent a mail on click of a button to get tested.
Instruction to use the app - Go to https://www.make.powerapps.com. Click on Sign In and enter the username as hackon2.0@saisunny.onmicrosoft.com. Click Next and the password is hbB?pb52_. Click on Skip for now (14 days until this is required). Now go to Apps and click on Safescan. So you can open any of the two images attached. Once the app opens you can type the shop Id and Submit.(The scan qr option is only available for mobile devices). So Now you can open the Admin Portal for Safescan andy you can see the there is an item. So if there is a positive case recorded in a place where ithers visited you can click the send email button and then it will send an email to outlook.You can sign in to outlook using the below username and password.
